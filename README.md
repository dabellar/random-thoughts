# CS 132 Creative Project 4: Node/Express API
## Random Thoughts

### About 
For the fourth creative project, we needed to show our understanding of Node/Express API. I decided to create a simple random thought saver where users can write (POST) and view (GET) random thoughts within a set of given categories.

### Things I Would Change/Update
I would rely more on CSS for the filtering, but the requirements of the assignment made using a fetch call make more sense. Something I will definitely update soon is giving the user the power to make their own filters. Right now, this website is tailored to my random thoughts, but I want to theoretically be used by anyone.

### How to Run the Project

For development, you will only need [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/current) installed in your environment.
